# MIT Admissions(Slideroom)
For my 2022-23 undergraduate first year application (Creative Maker Portfolio), Application Reference number: 829395924


Please note that the code for game LUDO is completely my own creation here. It is a computerized version of a popular board game. It is written and uploaded in an Eclipse workspace folder. The numbered version are prototypes in progress order and the unnumbered version contains the finalised main function.

The gaming engine was a work in progress and worked briefly. Many concepts in it were heavily inspired by Youtube tutorials, but most of it is my original code, which I worked in a notebook before programming. It is currently non functional, as I left it more than five years ago.

The linear equations java file is the one submitted in the slideroom pdf.

Please note that I have temporarily stopped coding to focus on other parts of my life. The last I coded was the LUDO game in 2019.

Thankyou for your time! Admissions Office
